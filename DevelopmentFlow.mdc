# Development Flow for Drone Defense Mini

## Module Structure
We'll organize the game code into these distinct modules:

1. **Core**: Game loop, initialization, and state management
2. **Renderer**: 3D rendering, scene setup, and camera management
3. **Input**: Player controls for desktop and mobile
4. **Entities**: Game objects (drones, projectiles, base)
5. **UI**: HUD elements and game state screens
6. **Audio**: Sound effects and music
7. **Utils**: Helper functions and utilities

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Core Setup (Day 1, Morning)
1. Refine existing game and renderer setup
2. Implement proper game state management
3. Create entity management system for tracking game objects
4. Set up fixed position camera with rotation controls

### Phase 2: Player Mechanics (Day 1, Afternoon)
1. Implement shooting mechanics
   - Raycasting for hit detection
   - Visual feedback for shooting
2. Create player base entity
   - Simple geometry
   - Health system
3. Implement basic HUD
   - Health display
   - Score counter
   - Wave indicator

### Phase 3: Enemy System (Day 1, Evening)
1. Create drone base class
   - Movement logic
   - Health system
   - Collision detection
2. Implement different drone types
   - Basic drone
   - Fast drone
   - Tank drone
3. Create wave management system
   - Spawning logic
   - Difficulty progression
   - Wave completion detection

### Phase 4: Gameplay Refinement (Day 2, Morning)
1. Implement game states
   - Start screen
   - Pause functionality
   - Game over condition and screen
2. Add scoring system
   - Points for destroying drones
   - Multipliers for consecutive hits
3. Implement visual effects
   - Shooting effects
   - Explosion particles
   - Hit indicators

### Phase 5: Audio & Polish (Day 2, Afternoon)
1. Add basic audio
   - Sound effects
   - Background music
2. Mobile optimization
   - Touch controls
   - Performance adjustments
3. Visual improvements
   - Lighting enhancements
   - Color scheme refinement
   - Environmental elements

### Phase 6: Testing & Deployment (Day 2, Evening)
1. Cross-browser testing
2. Mobile device testing
3. Performance optimization
4. Add competition badge
5. Final adjustments and bug fixes
6. Deployment

## Implementation Priority

Focus on implementing features in this order:
1. **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)**: 
   - Fixed camera with rotation
   - Simple shooting
   - Basic drone movement
   - Hit detection
   
2. **Core Gameplay**:
   - Multiple drone types
   - Wave system
   - Health system
   - Basic UI
   
3. **Polish Features** (if time allows):
   - Visual effects
   - Audio
   - Additional drone types
   - Advanced scoring

This approach ensures we have a playable game as quickly as possible, with refinements added as time permits. The modular structure allows us to work on components independently and integrate them smoothly.
