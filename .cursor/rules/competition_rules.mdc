## Our Game Concept: "Treasure Hunter"
- An extraction-based game where players enter procedurally generated dungeons
- Players collect valuable items while navigating through the environment
- Risk vs. reward: Better items help in future runs but can be lost if player dies
- Simple but engaging core loop: Enter ‚Üí Collect ‚Üí Extract safely (or die trying)
- Quick to play, easy to understand, challenging to master
